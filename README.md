# Minecraft CPU Compiler
Compiler of an invented high-level language into assembly language accepted by my Minecraft CPU (see repo for this project https://github.com/LemonAndLimee/minecraft-CPU). A learning project for me to understand more about how compilers work.

Working towards accepting a current language which includes:
- Variables (current with a single data type, 'byte')
- If/else statements
- For and While loops
- The following operators (following C++ notation standards): +, -, *, /, %, ==, !=, <=, >=, <, >, !, ||, &&, |, &, <<, >>
